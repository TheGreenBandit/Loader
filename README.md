A loader made in dx11, using imgui to display.

based upon [Niplix's dx9 loader](https://github.com/ALEHACKsp/Loader-Base/tree/main)

to build, define your tokens in the token.hpp file to have the ability to download releases,
the discord token is unimportant as it is just required for chatting through the loader.
